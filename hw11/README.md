===

For this assignment, I work with [Lithia](https://github.com/lithiah). The website we wrote uses [uikit](http://getuikit.com/index.html) as the CSS front-end frameworks, and aims to help Wheaton College (MA) students to browse and choose [connection courses](http://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/the-wheaton-curriculum/connections/connections-list/) more easily. The link of [Wheaton Course Connections](http://wheatonconnections.me/) website can be found here: http://wheatonconnections.me/ You can also checkout our project page: [WheatonConnections](https://github.com/lithiah/WheatonConnections/tree/gh-pages)
